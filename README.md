# RSAcrack 🔒💥

Welcome to the **RSAcrack** repository! This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate vulnerabilities in RSA encryption and how to crack it using various algorithms and techniques. 🚀

## 📌 Overview

RSAcrack aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for understanding and exploiting weaknesses in RSA encryption. It is intended for security researchers, ethical hackers, and students interested in cryptography.

## 🌟 Features

- **Brute Force Attack**: Implements a brute force method to crack weak RSA keys. 🔑  
- **Factorization Methods**: Utilizes algorithms like Pollard's rho and Fermat’s method for efficient factorization of large numbers. 🧮  
- **Key Size Analysis**: Evaluate the security of RSA keys based on size and algorithmic strength. 📊  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate command-line interface for executing attacks and analyzing results. 🖥️

## 📖 Usage
Brute Force Attack: Use the command python rsa_crack.py --brute <public_key> to initiate a brute force attack.
Factorization: Run python rsa_crack.py --factor <n> to factor a given RSA modulus.
Check Key Strength: Use python rsa_crack.py --check <key> to evaluate the strength of an RSA key.
